# Applied Data Science Capstone

This repository is used for the Applied Data Science Capstone Project for the IBM Profession Certificate. Below you can find the description of the problem to solve.

The city of Buenos Aires has to cathegorize their neighborhoods in order recognize the commercial areas from the living areas. This is mainly to see how the town hall is going to allocate the funds destined for commercial growth and for living subsidies.

The objective of this project is to segment the neighborhoods in 5 different categories:

1. Very High Commercial Area
2. High Commercial Area
3. Mid level Commercial Area
4. Low Commercial Area
5. Very Low Commercial Area

So that the City of Buenos Aires will be able to allocate the 2020 funds to mantain "Very High Commercial Areas", Grow "High Commercial Areas", and invest in living areas in the other categories.

Also the project will provide a visual prove of the information gathered, so that the allocation decisions can be analyzed taking in consideration the location of the nieghborhoods. 

For this project the following data will be used:

- Buenos Aires Neighborhoods data set - https://data.buenosaires.gob.ar/dataset/barrios
- Foursquare near venues - https://es.foursquare.com/

This data will be used to analyze the density of commercial venues in all the neighborhoods from Buenos Aires and segment them into the previously mentioned cathegories.
